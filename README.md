## Context on the Project

I have chosen the Track 2 for the Assignment

The project I'm working on is called "The Impact of Entrepreneurship Capital in Economic Performance at Latin America Countries".

Studies suggest that entrepreneurship has a positive and significant effect on economic growth. As most of the previous researches focus on nothern and developed countries like those from the OECD, the research tries to look for a different approach investigating the countries in Latin America.

The measurement used for entrepreneurship is called Total Entrepreneurship Activity (TEA)
